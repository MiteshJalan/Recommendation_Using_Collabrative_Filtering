This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of collaborative filtering recommender systems,It starts by implementing basics collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based collaborative filering also known as user-to-user collaborative filtering. It presents models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Singular Value Decomposition Plus Plus(SVDpp).

Requirements
matplotlib==3.2.2
numpy==1.19.2
pandas==1.0.5
python==3.7
scikit-surprise==1.1.1
scipy==1.6.2

Content
The topics covered in this repository are as follows : We first explore the data

Data exploration : this notebook explores a small part of user dataset. This dataset is used throughout this repository to build collaborative filtering recommender systems.
Then the model we implemented are the followings

1. User-based (or user to user) Collaborative Filtering : implements user-based collaborative filtering.

2. Explored models:

  Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) : implements Singular Value Decomposition for collaborative filtering recommender systems

  Singular Value Decomposition Plus Plus (SVDpp) : implements Singular Value Decomposition for collaborative filtering recommender systems

3. Performances comparison
Performances comparison: this notebook presents an overall performance comparaison of both the the models listed above.
