# Recommendation System For Stories

This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of collaborative filtering recommender systems,It starts by implementing basics collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based collaborative filering also known as user-to-user collaborative filtering. It presents models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Singular Value Decomposition Plus Plus(SVDpp).




## Prerequisites



```bash
python==3.7
plotly==5.7.0
pandas==1.0.5
numpy==1.19.2
scikit-surprise==1.1.1
```
    
## Content

The Topics covered in this repository are as follows :
-  We first explore the data

- Data exploration : this notebook explores a small part of user dataset. This dataset is used throughout this repository to build collaborative filtering recommender systems.
Then the model we implemented are the followings
### 1. User-based (or user to user) Collaborative Filtering : 
- Implements user-based collaborative filtering.

### 2. Explored models:

  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) : implements Singular Value Decomposition for collaborative filtering recommender systems

 -  Singular Value Decomposition Plus Plus (SVDpp) : implements Singular Value Decomposition for collaborative filtering recommender systems

### 3. Performances comparison
- Performances comparison: this notebook presents an overall performance comparaison of both the the models listed above.
